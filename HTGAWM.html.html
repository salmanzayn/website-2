<p style="color: rgb(214, 182, 231);">1.1 Choose Your Weapon Wisely:
    Forget about knives, guns, or poison. The real secret weapon? A rubber chicken! Not only will it baffle investigators, <br>but it'll also provide endless entertainment as they try to piece together the fowl play.
    <br>
    1.2 Leave Your Signature:
    Why settle for anonymity when you can leave your mark? Literally! Sign your name in glitter at the crime scene for that extra sparkle. Bonus points if you leave a Yelp review of your own dastardly deed.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2: Planning Your Perfect Murder (Or Perfectly Ridiculous Mishap)
</h3>
2.1 Location, Location, Location:
Who needs secrecy when you can host a murder gala at the local zoo? Just imagine the headlines:<br>
 "Lion's Roar Mistaken for Dying Scream."
<br>
2.2 Alibi Schmalibi:<br>
Why bother with alibis when you can blame it on your evil twin?<br> After all, who's going to suspect you when they're busy chasing your doppelg√§nger?

<h3>Chapter 3: Dealing with the Aftermath (Or Lack Thereof)</h3>

3.1 Cleaning Up the Mess:
Forget bleach and gloves. <br>Embrace the power of glitter bombs and confetti cannons!<br> Who says crime scenes can't be fabulous?
<br>
3.2 Facing the Music:
If all else fails, just break into a spontaneous musical number during interrogation.<br> It's hard to convict someone when they're belting out show tunes!

And there you have it, folks! <br>"The Not-So-Serious Guide to Getting Away with Murder" may not earn you a spot in the criminal mastermind hall of fame, <br>but it'll definitely earn you a few laughs (and maybe some concerned looks). <br>Remember, crime doesn't pay, but comedy sure does!</font></p>
